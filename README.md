A Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict a user’s “rating” or “preference” towards a domain-specific item or item. In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie. Therefore the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.
**Project Overview:**
In this project, I developed a recommendation system that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences. It's powered by collaborative filtering, leveraging user ratings and movie correlations to generate tailored suggestions.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Analysis:** Explored and analyzed movie ratings and user data to gain insights into viewing patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed the dataset for modeling.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Implemented collaborative filtering algorithms to calculate movie similarities and generate recommendations.
- **User Interaction:** Users can input their favorite movies, and the system suggests similar titles they might enjoy.
- **Visualizations:** Created visualizations to showcase movie ratings distribution, correlation heatmaps, and more.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for modeling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for development
